This code is undocumented and represents my attempt to write a simple lexer
and parser in the past. 

This is in no way representiative of my current ability or skill.
These artifacts are posted in good faith, with only the intention of
serving as a personal record viewable for myself and any other amateur or 
professional.

For other students, I will trust that you view this repository 
without the intention of plagarism.

(It's pretty bad, I don't know why you would.)
